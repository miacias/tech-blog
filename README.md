# Tech Blog

model-view-controller forum site for publishing and commenting on blog posts

## Description

This is a complete blog site for any and all tech related thoughts and aspirations. One of the main functions of the web is to connect humans of the world to resources, knowledge, and social circles that may otherwise be physically inaccessible due to distance. This blog site offers tech gurus to share their wealth of knowledge, for developers to discuss their discoveries, and for those interested in technology to find inspiration and hopefully an entry point into the world of tech.

This project was a rush to complete all components in one week! It was valuable to practice front-to-back connections via fetch requests and database queries. As an introduction to the Model-View-Controller format, it is clear that each element plays an important role, and without it, a website or web app would not be able to serve anything more than a surface-level purpose.
