## Roadmap

Content will be added and adjusted as new coding projects are available! Some projects may phase out over time as my work becomes more specialized. Some desired features and functionality to be added in the future:
- editing features: for blog writers and commenters
- instant page load: show new content as it is added or changed without needing to manually refresh the page
- server session cookies that are handled by the code and not stored in the browser; the app currently works best in Incognito Mode for this reason
- ensure mobile-friendly responsive view using Bootstrap classes and breakpoints


## Contribution
